Project Euler Solver: Largest Product in a Grid
===============================================

**Largest_Prod_Grid** is a Python program that solves a mathematics problem posed
by `Project Euler <https://projecteuler.net/>`_: 

Given a 20 x 20 table of numbers, find the largest product of four adjacent
numbers. The four numbers can run in any of these directions: up, down, left,
right, or diagonal.

Largest_Prod_Grid generalizes the solution -- it can compute the largest 
product of four adjacent numbers in table that's at least 4 x 4.

The code lives in `this repo <hhttps://github.com/XtinaJohnson/largest_prod_grid/>`_, which also contains two samples text files that contain tables. (See more about these examples in :doc:`usage`.)

.. note::

   This program reports only the largest product. Future versions will report the four
   factors and their locations in the table.

We describe how to use the program in :doc:`usage`.

To see how the program is implemented, see :doc:`impl`.
